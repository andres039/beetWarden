BeetWarden is an exercise where BaaS is applied with the help of Convex. For the front end I used Mantine components.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Currently working on

* Improving the layouts
* Encrypting passwords
* Improving error handling
* Creating a password generator feature

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
